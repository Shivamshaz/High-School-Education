        <h2>About US</h2><br>
        Designer Duo, Shivam Bansal and yogesh vijay, promoters of Fashion Label H2O and CUE jointly launched their Dream Project, Indian Art Gallery(based in New Delhi) in year 2001. Indian Art
        Gallery situated in the heart of New Delhi - prides itself with the most unique collection of Contemporary Art in India.<br>
        The duo's first show was based on colour, which was intrinsic to art and fashion, with participation of about 40 artists. Top and budding names of the art fraternity were part of this show.
        "We gave them the colour forecast for the season and then made some clothes based on the paintings," they said. One called "Sheen of Metal" revolved around the metallic paints they used in
        which noted artist Thota Vaikuntam (from Hyderabad) did something different from his usual stylised signature.<br>
        Art Gallery 2002, curated by Shivam Bansal and yogesh vijay, marked the second anniversary of the Indian art Gallery (New Delhi) and was exhibited at the India Habitat Centre (IHC). It
        reflected a curious blend of the conventional and the avant garde, the known and the lesser known, the young and the old Indian Artists.<br>
        A particularly inspiring veena player by M F Husain, a result of the artists skilled application of colour. Similarly, the S H Raza and Jogen Chowdhury in this selection were unique in their
        treatment.<br>
        Ever Since, the duo have exhibited several Collections and the Indian Art Gallery prides itself in sales close to 99 per cent within a fortnight, “There has also been increased awareness
        among buyers who do their homework. The trend shows that there is less demand for decorative arts,” says Shivam Bansal.<br>
        The Online Art Gallery New Delhi, ie, www.HighSchool.com brings to you details of all exhibitions held in the past and the forthcoming show. The Online Gallery is updated daily so the user
        can view and buy the latest collection available at 14 Golf Links, New Delhi, India from any where in the world.<br>
